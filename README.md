## Hi, Asad here üòç 

### About Me

I completed my matriculation at Five Star Public School and my intermediate studies at Al-Asar Academy in Usterzai Payan, Kohat, Pakistan. Recently, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Sukkur IBA University, where I was honored to be the gold medalist for my outstanding performance.

I began my professional career as a Junior Software Engineer during the 4th semester of my graduation in the software industry. In parallel, I have been working on Fiverr and Upwork. During my 6th semester, I started focusing on Data Science and Machine Learning. After earning specialization certificates from Coursera, including courses by Andrew Ng, I began working on real-world projects. I completed my final year project (FYP) titled "Classification of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal from X-rays using Deep Learning Techniques."

Currently, I am seeking positions and scholarships abroad in the fields of Machine Learning and AI. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and further my knowledge in these cutting-edge areas.
